## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As an aspiring researcher and BTech student at VIT Chennai, I have dedicated my academic journey to exploring the intersections of cloud computing, machine learning, and optimization algorithms. My research work, which includes the development of innovative models like the Modified Chimp-Whale Optimization Algorithm (MCWOA) and the Modified Dense Convolutional Network (MDCN), reflects a strong commitment to advancing technological solutions in both cloud environments and agricultural systems. I have actively contributed to international collaborations with leading research institutions, resulting in the submission of a research paper to Nature Scientific Reports.<br>
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on advanced optimization algorithms for cloud computing, funded research projects on AI-driven solutions, and federated learning-based disease detection models.<br>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep learning techniques and their applications in edge computing and cybersecurity.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cutting-edge research and development in optimization algorithms, cloud environments, and AI-based systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cloud computing, advanced optimization, federated learning, and international research collaborations.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chirag-chandrashekar-b6a6b920a/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy tackling real-world challenges with innovative AI-driven solutions.
